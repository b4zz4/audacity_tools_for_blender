# Audacity Tools For Blender
Open Sound Strip, Sequence or Record in Audacity. 

Only a proof of concept, so don't use it for real work! 

Contributions welcome.

Tutorial:
Before running this add-on, Audacity must be running with Preferences > Modules > mod_script_pipe Enabled(after a restart of Audacity). 
Blender will only run this add-on once, and needs a restart for rerun.
